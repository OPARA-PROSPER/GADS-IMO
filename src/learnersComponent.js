        bio: `I am Ndubuisi, currently a Computer Science final year student of Federal
              Polytechnic Nekede. Prior to the ALC 4.0 scholarship program which started
              around June 2019, I have had this  passion for software development, though
              the school curriculum is more theory aligned without much hands on experience
              and practice. Due to my inquisitiveness (don't mind me ðŸ˜†) to learn programming
              outside what the school offered, I started surfing the www to find solutions,
              hopefully I stumbled upon a tweet about the ALC GADS and without a second thought
              I gave it a shot and applied!, your guess is as good, I got in and here I am today
              without regrets. I made it to the project phase of the program as a first-timer.
              I have built some cool apps, check them out on github:
              https://github.com/ugwulo/notekeeper
              https://github.com/ugwulo/Androi-candyCodedApplication(my project)
              Currently working on this one https://github.com/ugwulo/GradePoint.
              I'm currently improving my Java, Firebase and UI skills.
              Learning is a continuous process and I see myself beyond my dreams.
              Shout out to Andela for organizing this epic program, Google Africa for the
              funding and Pluralsight for providing their top notch platform for learning. It has
              been a wonderful experience for me and I won't let this opportunity go down the drains.
              Thank you for being here ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—`,

              worked on projects which is on my github profile also learnt about
              Angular for the first time. I had to learn  a whole lot of new concepts
              and amazing technologies which I did (thanks to the awesome course instructors
              and side projects) and was really amazed by just how much a single
              javascript code allowed me to do on the frontend. Pushing code to
              GitHub was really exciting as I had to really learn the basics of 
              Git and GitHub bet you  won't even be forgetting it soon lol but 
              github was fun learning and versioning generally.
        
              The scholarship for me was an awesome time investment and it took me
              to meet new guys and know lots of things happening in tech

              I feel my greatest skill is learning and excelling at new technologies. 

              I started out on the cloud (GCP) in the Google Developer Scholarship for the
              very first time. I learnt to work with App Engine, APIs and got to explore
              networking, storage and security on the cloud and containerization technologies
              like Docker and Kubernetes. I think the best of it all was using BigQuery,
              DataProc and other ML technologies hosted on GCP. 
        
              I'm impressed that having the right skill-sets to generate deeper insights from
              data could be an effective way of solving the problems of today and tomorrow.

              I didn't get to the project phase on this program, but I certainly became better at
              writing javascript, CSS, HTML,  and I learnt the basics of Angular.js.
              I've currently taken the steps to get started with open source contribution, and I
              hope to move forward with this, as that will give me ample chance to do the things that
              matter with my skills and also learn from working on code bases that are bigger than the
